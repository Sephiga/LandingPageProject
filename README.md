# LandingPageProject

This is my first CSS project!

I don't think that I grasped every concept perfectly just yet. I still have trouble with a lot of things, but i'll get better in time.

Anywho, here is my first landing page!

King Bowser has created a fund to let the goombas have a kingdom of their own! How exciting! This is the fresh start that we have been waiting for, especially since Princess Toadstool(Peach) and the Mushroom kingdom are not too kind to Goombas, especially those evil Mario Brothers! We finally will have a place of our own. Now the only problem is, There are a bunch of Goomba across the world. How do we reach them and spread the word that there is a new haven for Goomba-kind? 

I (Sephigoomba) approached King Bowser with the idea of a website, one that we will build and improve upon overtime to connect all Goombas. However, all races are invited to live here! We accept everyone, especially the displaced members of Bowser's army. We will not judge or discriminate.

Together, we are going to make this new home thrive. Onward to the Goomba Kingdom!
